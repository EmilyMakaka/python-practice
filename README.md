This respiratory is about simple exercises used to practice proggramming concepts including recursion and loops in which I solved using python. The functions i implemented include:
 1. Sum all elements in a list - this function calculates the sum of all the elements in a list of numbers using a loop
  
 2. Check if a number is even or odd - this function checks if a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator
 
 3. Compute factorial using a loop - this function calculates the factorial using a loop
 
 4. Reverse a string - this function is used to reverse a string without using biult-in methods
 
 5. Factorial using recursion - this function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

 6. Sum of digits of a number - this function caculates the sum of the digits of a number using a loop
